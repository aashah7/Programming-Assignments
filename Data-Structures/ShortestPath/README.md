<h1>Shortest Path Using Priority Queue</h1>

<p><i>Java</i></p>

A class that uses a priority queue to compute the shortest path from the starting point ( 0 , 0 ) to the ending point (the lower right corner) of a grid. The shortest path includes the lowest sum of each individual cell that was visited. The path from the starting point to the end point that contains the largest minimum can also be computed.
